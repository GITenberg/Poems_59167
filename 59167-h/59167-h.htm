<span class="i0">Was three long mountains and a wood;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I turned and looked another way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And saw three islands in a bay.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So with my eyes I traced the line<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the horizon, thin and fine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Straight around till I was come<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Back to where I’d started from<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all I saw from where I stood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was three long mountains and a wood.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Over these things I could not see:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These were the things that bounded me;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I could touch them with my hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Almost, I thought, from where I stand.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all at once things seemed so small<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My breath came short, and scarce at all.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, sure, the sky is big, I said;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Miles and miles above my head;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So here upon my back I’ll lie<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And look my fill into the sky.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And so I looked, and, after all,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sky was not so very tall.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sky, I said, must somewhere stop,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And—sure enough!—I see the top!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sky, I thought, is not so grand;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I ’most could touch it with my hand!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And reaching up my hand to try,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I screamed to feel it touch the sky.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I screamed, and—lo!—Infinity<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came down and settled over me;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forced back my scream into my chest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bent back my arm upon my breast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, pressing of the Undefined<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The definition on my mind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Held up before my eyes a glass<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through which my shrinking sight did pass<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Until it seemed I must behold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Immensity made manifold;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whispered to me a word whose sound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deafened the air for worlds around,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And brought unmuffled to my ears<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The gossiping of friendly spheres,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The creaking of the tented sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The ticking of Eternity.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I saw and heard and knew at last<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The How and Why of all things, past,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And present, and for evermore.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Universe, cleft to the core,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lay open to my probing sense<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That, sick’ning, I would fain pluck thence<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But could not,—nay! But needs must suck<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At the great wound, and could not pluck<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My lips away till I had drawn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All venom out.—Ah, fearful pawn!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For my omniscience paid I toll<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In infinite remorse of soul.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All sin was of my sinning, all<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Atoning mine, and mine the gall<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of all regret. Mine was the weight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of every brooded wrong, the hate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That stood behind each envious thrust,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mine every greed, mine every lust.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all the while for every grief,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each suffering, I craved relief<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With individual desire,—<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Craved all in vain! And felt fierce fire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">About a thousand people crawl;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perished with each,—then mourned for all!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A man was starving in Capri;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He moved his eyes and looked at me;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I felt his gaze, I heard his moan,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And knew his hunger as my own.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I saw at sea a great fog bank<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Between two ships that struck and sank;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A thousand screams the heavens smote;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And every scream tore through my throat.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No hurt I did not feel, no death<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That was not mine; mine each last breath<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That, crying, met an answering cry<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the compassion that was I.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All suffering mine, and mine its rod;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mine, pity like the pity of God.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ah, awful weight! Infinity<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pressed down upon the finite Me!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My anguished spirit, like a bird,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beating against my lips I heard;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet lay the weight so close about<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There was no room for it without.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And so beneath the weight lay I<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And suffered death, but could not die.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Long had I lain thus, craving death,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When quietly the earth beneath<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gave way, and inch by inch, so great<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At last had grown the crushing weight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into the earth I sank till I<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Full six feet under ground did lie,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sank no more,—there is no weight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Can follow here, however great.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From off my breast I felt it roll,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as it went my tortured soul<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Burst forth and fled in such a gust<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That all about me swirled the dust.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deep in the earth I rested now;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cool is its hand upon the brow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And soft its breast beneath the head<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of one who is so gladly dead.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all at once, and over all<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The pitying rain began to fall;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I lay and heard each pattering hoof<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon my lowly, thatchèd roof,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And seemed to love the sound far more<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than ever I had done before.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For rain it hath a friendly sound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To one who’s six feet under ground;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And scarce the friendly voice or face:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A grave is such a quiet place.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The rain, I said, is kind to come<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And speak to me in my new home.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I would I were alive again<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To kiss the fingers of the rain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To drink into my eyes the shine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of every slanting silver line,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To catch the freshened, fragrant breeze<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From drenched and dripping apple-trees.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For soon the shower will be done,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then the broad face of the sun<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will laugh above the rain-soaked earth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Until the world with answering mirth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shakes joyously, and each round drop<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rolls, twinkling, from its grass-blade top.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How can I bear it, buried here,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While overhead the sky grows clear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And blue again after the storm?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O, multi-coloured, multiform,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beloved beauty over me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That I shall never, never see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Again! Spring-silver, autumn-gold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That I shall never more behold!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sleeping your myriad magics through,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Close-sepulchred away from you!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O God, I cried, give me new birth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And put me back upon the earth!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upset each cloud’s gigantic gourd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And let the heavy rain, down-poured<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In one big torrent, set me free,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Washing my grave away from me!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I ceased; and through the breathless hush<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That answered me, the far-off rush<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of herald wings came whispering<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like music down the vibrant string<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of my ascending prayer, and—crash!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before the wild wind’s whistling lash<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The startled storm-clouds reared on high<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And plunged in terror down the sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the big rain in one black wave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fell from the sky and struck my grave.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I know not how such things can be;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I only know there came to me<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A fragrance such as never clings<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To aught save happy living things;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A sound as of some joyous elf<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Singing sweet songs to please himself,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, through and over everything,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A sense of glad awakening.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The grass, a-tiptoe at my ear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whispering to me I could hear;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I felt the rain’s cool finger-tips<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brushed tenderly across my lips,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Laid gently on my sealèd sight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all at once the heavy night<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fell from my eyes and I could see,—<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A drenched and dripping apple-tree,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A last long line of silver rain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A sky grown clear and blue again.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as I looked a quickening gust<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of wind blew up to me and thrust<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into my face a miracle<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of orchard-breath, and with the smell,—<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I know not how such things can be!—<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I breathed my soul back into me.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Ah! Up then from the ground sprang I<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hailed the earth with such a cry<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As is not heard save from a man<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who has been dead, and lives again.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">About the trees my arms I wound;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like one gone mad I hugged the ground;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I raised my quivering arms on high;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I laughed and laughed into the sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till at my throat a strangling sob<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Caught fiercely, and a great heart-throb<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sent instant tears into my eyes;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O God, I cried, no dark disguise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Can e’er hereafter hide from me<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy radiant identity!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou canst not move across the grass<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But my quick eyes will see Thee pass,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor speak, however silently,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But my hushed voice will answer Thee.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I know the path that tells Thy way<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through the cool eve of every day;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">God, I can push the grass apart<br /></span>

be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
